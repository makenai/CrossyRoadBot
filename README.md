#Welcome, CascadiaFest 2016 and internet people!

Here you will find the source code to the Crossy RoadBoat demo software from my talk. It's not guaranteed to be pretty, well organized or bug free but it's all laid out here for your exploration!

If you just want to see the slides from the presentation, they are here: https://github.com/makenai/CrossyRoadBot/blob/master/cascadia16-slides.pdf
